Projects According to Scott Belsky, there are three primary components of every
project:

Action Steps are the specific, concrete tasks that inch you forward: redraft and
send the memo, post the blog entry, pay the electricity bill, etc. References
are any project-related handouts, sketches, notes, meeting minutes, manuals, or
ongoing discussions that you may want to refer back to. References are not
actionable; they are resources. Backburner Items, finally, are things that are
not actionable now but may be actionable someday. Perhaps it is an idea for a
client for which there is no budget yet. Or maybe it is something you intend to
do in a particular project at an unforeseen time in the future. Instead of
creating folders, subfolders, tasks and subtasks for each of your projects, you
create one mem for your project, and use tags and bidirectional links to make it
possible to find exactly what you need, when you need it.

Your mem for each project should contain the following metadata:

Status Deadline Category/Context Overview and goals Tasks related to the project
Relevant resources for this project When you gather all the relevant resources
for a project in one place before you begin work on it, you're able to separate
work execution from workflow and move projects forward at a much faster pace.
