<!-- Projects
According to Scott Belsky, there are three primary components of every project:

Action Steps are the specific, concrete tasks that inch you forward: redraft and send the memo, post the blog entry, pay the electricity bill, etc.
References are any project-related handouts, sketches, notes, meeting minutes, manuals, or ongoing discussions that you may want to refer back to. References are not actionable; they are resources.
Backburner Items, finally, are things that are not actionable now but may be actionable someday. Perhaps it is an idea for a client for which there is no budget yet. Or maybe it is something you intend to do in a particular project at an unforeseen time in the future.
Instead of creating folders, subfolders, tasks and subtasks for each of your projects, you create one mem for your project, and use tags and bidirectional links to make it possible to find exactly what you need, when you need it.

Your mem for each project should contain the following metadata:

Status
Deadline
Category/Context
Overview and goals
Tasks related to the project
Relevant resources for this project
When you gather all the relevant resources for a project in one place before you begin work on it, you're able to separate work execution from workflow and move projects forward at a much faster pace. -->

## Area/Topic

<!-- Clinical/research area of the project -->

## Goal

<!-- What are you trying to accomplish -->

## Context

<!-- Background information -->

## Success Criteria

<!-- milestones for this project -->

## Log

<!-- For longer projects, keep a rough log of major events-->

## Outputs

<!-- any outputs that were generated from this project. eg. slides, videos, etc-->

<!-- Everything below this line is work needed to achieve the stated goal-->

## Tasks

<!-- use this space to track current tasks. alternatively, you can also link to your daily journal note -->

## Notes

<!-- use this space for arbitrary notes -->

## Lookup

<!-- relevant prior work or resources -->
